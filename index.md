# Board member plans for the first two months

#### Tomas Petricek, 6 July 2017

Back in May 2017, the F# Software Foundation [elected the new Board of 
Trustees](http://foundation.fsharp.org/2017_annual_members_meeting). In the previous years,
many people in the F# community found it hard to see what exactly the board is doing and 
how are individual board members contributing. To help with this, I thought it would be a good
idea to keep track of what the board is up to.

On May 30, I posted the following question to the F# Foundation Slack channel:

> I have one question for everyone on the board @lenadroid @chethusk @edgarsanchez @selketjah @kit 
> @mathias @swlaschin @realvictorprm @yukitos - What is one thing that you plan to do as a board 
> member in the next two months? I know how hard it is to do larger things, so this could be really 
> anything - even a small thing - that can be marked as "done" after two months. (...)

## Answers from members

Everyone from the board was happy to share their plans for the first two months and I got answers
from everyone in a day or two. I was a bit slow at putting them online (sorry!) but here are the
plans for all the board members (slightly edited for formatting):

 * **Alena Hall** ([@lenadroid](http://twitter.com/lenadroid)) - Finish draft of "open agenda" and 
  help make it happen [edit: "open agenda" would let the community see and contribute topics for
  the agenda of the monthly FSSF board meetings.]
  
 * **Chet Husk** ([@chethusk](http://twitter.com/chethusk)) - I intend to collate resources I've used 
  for the reforming Austin F# meetup and contribute one or more documents to the 'Learn' page of the 
  [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org) site.

 * **Edgar Sanchez** ([@edgarsanchez](http://twitter.com/edgarsanchez)) - Make the F# |> Quito 
  [meetup] a thing, and by extension, get one or two additional countries to have a working F#
  [user group].

 * **Gien Verschatse** ([@selketjah](http://twitter.com/selketjah)) [I will work on] getting a 
  'draft' ready for "adopt a speaker" [programme].

 * **Kit Eason** ([@kitlovesfsharp](https://twitter.com/kitlovesfsharp)) - [O]ne of my concerns is 
  the state of the F# jobs market; and one component of that is lack of insight by recruiters as to 
  what F# is, how to attract and engage with F# devs etc.  So - how about a doc, [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org) 
  page or even event, specifically for recruiters, that answers these questions. (...)
  [As a second two-month commitment, I'll] research how other communities approach diversity 
  (JS, Python, SheCanCode, Rails, Scala (free courses), Lambda Ladies). 

 * **Mathias Brandewinder** ([@brandewinder](https://twitter.com/brandewinder)) - [I will]
  keep being on [the #fssf channel] every Friday for office hours, find where my "how to start and 
  run a meetup" notes are and make them into resources on [community.fsharp.org](http:community.fsharp.org), 
  advertise and simplify the speakers program, figure out how to efficiently distribute stickers.

 * **Scott Wlaschin** ([@ScottWlaschin](http://twitter.com/ScottWlaschin)) - [No answer.]
 
 * **Victor Peter Rouven MÃ¼ller** ([@realvictorprm](http://twitter.com/realvictorprm)) [U]pdate 
  [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org) in such a way that we can start with education-support and listing 
  important F# OSS projects and their needs. (...). I first want to improve support for education 
  and meanwhile try to work out what is possible for OSS (...).

 * **Yukitoshi Suzuki** ([@yukitos](http://twitter.com/yukitos)) - I'd want to find any ways to 
  support [multiple] languages on [the] [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org) web site.

## Final notes

It has now been over a month since I asked the above questions, so I will be getting touch with 
everyone over the next week to get an update and share it here. This page is hosted on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/the-fsharp-mirror) and so please send any corrections of typos or
misleading wording (where I edited an answer badly) as pull request.

As a disclaimer - I'm not currently a board member, but I was a board member until 2016. Two 
of the current board members, Mathias Brandewinder and Scott Wlaschin are also my partners at
[fsharpworks.com](https://fsharpworks.com/).
